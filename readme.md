The ColdBox MVC Platform comes embedded with WireBox for dependency injection.  WireBox requires no configuration to start using and will automatically look for properties with an "inject" attribute.  For each property, it will create and insert a referece to other CFC when it creates your object.  This is called "mixin" inject because your dependencies are "mixed in" for you at runtime.  

In this example WireBox will create variables for us in our ColdBox handler as well as our GreeterService.  Injection is an alternative to calling getModel() every time we need an object, but remember, the references are created and injected once, so never inject a transient into a singleton.  For instance, injecting a loggedInUser object into the SecurityService would be incorrect.
